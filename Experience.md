My research mainly centers on decision-making and self-control.

•	I am designing studies to measure how individualism and collectivism influence how policy makers set default options: do they set default options based on what they think is best, or do they set default options based on what most people think is best? Learn more about this research design [here](research.md)!

•	Measuring how individualism and collectivism influences how policy makers set default options and how decision makers interpret them.

•	Proposed psychological mechanisms that underlie first- and second-order preferences and their implications for self-control.

•	Studied whether people think framing effects are mistakes; has potential implications for framing effects in medical and commercial settings.

•	Tested the correlation between psychologists’ perceived quality of their publications and the number of citations that these publications have.

•	Collaborating with Michael McCullough (UCSD) and Moshe Hoffman (Harvard University), seeking evolutionary reasons for why people proselytize.

•	Collaborated with Alice Diaz (University of Edinburgh), using personality datasets to predict life outcomes such as well-being.
