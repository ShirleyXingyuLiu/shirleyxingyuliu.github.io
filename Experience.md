## 2020-Present: Graduate research assistant at [McKenzie Lab, UCSD](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/cmckenzie.html) <sub> _La Jolla, CA_ </sub>

I'm working at the intersection between decision-making, social inferences, self-control, second-order preferneces, and causal reasoning.
Advisor: Craig McKenzie

•	Second-order preferences: undesirable desires and unachieved aspirations (with Craig McKenzie, Shlomi Sher, & Piotr Winkelman)
Sometimes, we have conflicts between what we prefer (_first-order preferences_) and what we prefer to prefer (_second-order preferences_). What are the different types of second-order preferences that different philosophers talk about? Do people have a lay intuition of second-order preference conflicts, and distinguish them from self-control conflicts? When we have second-order preferences for having different core preferences that shape who we are, how should we act? I'm currently working on answering these questions.[Read more](research.md)!

• Who accepts Description Invariance? (with Craig McKenzie and Shlomi Sher)	
Should we prefer 80%-lean beef to 20%-fat beef even if they're the same thing? We test whether lay people accept Description Invariance as a normative criteria for aessing whether framing effects are rational after reading arguments for and against Description Invariance. [Read more](research.md)!

•	When default options explain away preferences: a causal reasoning account of preference inferences (with Adena Schachner and Craig McKenzie)
We sometimes infer that people who actively switch away from a default option have stronger preferences than those who passively accept it. We propose a causal reasoning account to explain this asymmetric preference inference: while choice is often explained by preference, default options can sometimes provide alternative explanations for choice other than preference (e.g., default implying social recommendations, high cost of switching), weakening the interpretation that choices reflect preferences.

• Are self-nudges effective? (with Lim Leong, Craig McKenzie, and Celest Pilegard)
Nudges are successful, but they may infringe upon people's autonomy. Self-nudges, where people nudge themselves have been proposed as a more ehtical solution, but little is known about the effectiveness of self-nudges. We test whether people can effectively design nudges for themselves to facilitate goal achievenment. Currently we are testing whether psychology students at UCSD can set default options for themselves to facilitate attending review sessions.


Back Burner
•	I am interested in measuring how individualism and collectivism influence how policy makers set default options: do they set default options based on what they think is best, or do they set default options based on what most people think is best? 
•	I am interested in proposing an evolutionary reasons account of why people proselytize, and we are designing potential experiments to test out our hypotheses.
## 2020: Research fellow at the [Institute of Practical Ethics, UCSD](https://ipe.ucsd.edu/) <sub> _La Jolla, CA_ </sub>
Nudges are changes in one's choice environment that influence behaviors. Nudges are typically implemented by others, and have been shown to be very successful (e.g., many countries have sucessfully nudged people to donate organs by setting organ donation as the default policy). What if we don't want to be nudged by others? Can we successfully nudge ourselves? I found preliminary evidence that self-nudges--nudges implemented by oneself on oneself--are more effective than traditional nudges in facilitating self-control. [Read more](research.md)!

## 2020-2021: Graduate researcher at University of Edinburgh <sub> _Edinburgh, UK_ </sub>
I made use of a cross-cultural large personality dataset to compare the link between perceived control and well-being across cultures (this work is supervised by my advisor René Mõttus). I found that agentic control (taking action to change the environment) predicts well-being better in individualist cultures than in collectivist cultures at the country level, but adaptive control (adapting to the environment) predicts well-being better in individualist cultures than in collectivist cultures at the individual level. 

## 2019: Grantee for Rosen Travel Grant [Pomona College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona_College) <sub> _Claremont, CA_ </sub>
During my study abroad in France, I interviewed French strikers about their sense of conformity and group identity. I then conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses on how culture, conformity, and group identity motivate French and American strikers differently.

## 2017: Psychology research Intern at [Mend](https://www.letsmend.com/) <sub> _Santa Monica, CA_ <sub>
Mend is an app that helps its users recover from relationship breakups through blogs and audio trainings. I conducted research on people's psychological process when healing from a relationship breakup, and transformed my research into blogs, offering users behavioral advice to recover from relationship breakups.

## 2017: Research Assistant at Neural and Cultural Lab Pomona College <sub> _Claremont, CA_ </sub>
I tested people’s reaction to social norm violations in different cultures.
