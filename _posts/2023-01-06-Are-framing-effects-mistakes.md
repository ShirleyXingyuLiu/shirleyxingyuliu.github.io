## Framing effect

Read the below two scenarios carefully:

**Scenario 1**

Imagine that you have a friend over for dinner and you are preparing the meal. You know little about food products, but your friend is quite knowlegeable. One of the ingredants you are cooking with is ground beef. You are trying to learn a little about food from your friend and you two begin discussing meat, ground beef in particular. Your friend happens to mention that the ground beef you are using is "85% lean". 

How lean or fatty do you think this ground beef is relative to other ground beef on the market?

**Scenario 2**

Imagine that you have a friend over for dinner and you are preparing the meal. You know little about food products, but your friend is quite knowlegeable. One of the ingredants you are cooking with is ground beef. You are trying to learn a little about food from your friend and you two begin discussing meat, ground beef in particular. Your friend happens to mention that the ground beef you are using is "15% fat". 

How lean or fatty do you think this ground beef is relative to other ground beef on the market?

You may have noticed that the two scenarios are identical except one describes the ground beef in terms of how _**fatty**_ it is and the other describes the ground beef in terms of how _**lean**_ it is. 

Did you have the urge to rate the 85%-learn ground beef as leaner than the 15%-fat ground beef?

_**45% of the participants in my study did!**_

## Are framing effects mistakes? 
### Pyshcologists' opinions

This phenomenon you have just witnessed--people responding differently to different descriptions of the same object--is known as _framing effect_. 

Many psychologists argue that framing effects are mistakes because they violate the rational pricniple of<font color = "FC6B4C"> _description invaraiance_</font>: people's responses towards the same object should not change simply based on description. Here's an argument for <font color = "FC6B4C"> description invariance </font>:

<div align = "center">
<font color = "FC6B4C">
It is unreasonable for people to be influenced because the two descriptions convey exactly the same information about the ground beef.
If the ground beef is 85% lean, then it is also 15% fat, and vice versa. No matter what wording the speaker uses to describe the ground beef, the objective information is the same.
Because all that matters is the objective information in the description, it is unreasonable for people to be influenced by the way the speaker describes the ground beef.
<font color = "FC6B4C">
  </div>
  
Others believe that framing effects can be reasonable because of <font color = "3CD6BF"> _information leakage_</font>: speakers do not choose their frames randomly, and different frames may convey different information from the speaker. Here's an argument for <font color = "3CD6BF">information leakage </font>:

 <font color = "3CD6BF">
  <div align = "center">
It is reasonable for people to be influenced because when a speaker singles out one characteristic of an object (e.g., fatty or lean), it communicates that the object may stand out on that characteristic.
For example, a speaker may describe the ground beef in terms of how fatty it is if its fat content is higher than other ground beef on the market. The speaker's description of the ground beef's percentage of fat therefore suggests that the speaker thinks it is fattier than other ground beef. 
Because the speaker's wording may convey their beliefs, it is reasonable for people to be influenced by the way the speaker describes the ground beef.

The two scenarios you just saw, along with your response to each, are presented below. Please take a look now and notice that the two scenarios are identical except one describes the ground beef in terms of how fatty it is and the other describes the ground beef in terms of how lean it is.
