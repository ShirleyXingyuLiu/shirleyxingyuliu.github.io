People sometimes wish that they had different preferences than the ones they currently have. Frankenstein’s monster wishes that he didn’t want to be human. Goethe’s young Werther wishes that he didn’t love Charlotte. A smoker might wish that they didn’t like cigarettes. 

The preferences that people currently have are **_first-order preferences (P1s)_**, and their wish to have certain preferences are **_second-order preferences (P2s)_**. In other words, P1s are preferences for actions and objects, and P2s are preferences for preferences. When people wish to have different preferences than the ones they currently have, they have conflicting P1s and P2s. 

P1s and P2s have mostly been discussed in philosophy and economics. In our paper, we aimed to connect P1s and P2s to the psychological literature through addressing the below four questions:

## Under what conditions do conflicts between P1s and P2s emerge?

Synthesizing previous literature, we argue that P1s are reflexive preferences, whereas P2s are reflective preferences that take into account values and beliefs. We also expand the traditional definition of P1s as primal and visceral preferences, and suggest that P1s can be more sophisticated preferences that have turned habitual or reflexive: a workaholic has a P1 to always work, and this P1 more likely derived from their valuation of hard work—a more sophisticated preference—rather than their visceral enjoyment of working. 

Therefore, we say that P1s are driven by reflexes, which are one's tendency to act without deliberation, and reflexes can be visceral or sophisticated. We say that P2s are driven by reflections, which take into account values and beliefs. P1s and P2s conflict when reflexes and reflections conflict. In an interpersonal conflict, P1s are selfish and P2s take into account other people's benefits. For instance, a person may have a P1 for romantic affairs, but reflecting on their partner's faithfulness, they may form a P2 for having a different P1 that favors faithfulness as well. In an intrapersonal conflict, P1s focus on immediate satisfaction and P2s focus on long-temr goals. For instance, a person may have a P1 for spending all of their paycheck, but upon reflection, they may form a P2 for saving money to acheive their financial goals. 

## What cognitive mechanisms underlie conflicting P1s and P2s?

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## What should people do when their P1s and P2s conflict?

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## How do conflicting P1s and P2s relate to self-control?

## Conclusion
This was our attempt to addressing the curious phenomenon of wishing for preferences that one doesn't have, by bridging the philosophical definitions of P1s and P2s, the psychological mechanisms that give rise to conflicting P1s and P2s, and the behavioral implications of this conflict.
