In the last post, I introduced the concept of self-nudges--an ethical alternative to behavioral nudges. To reap, nudges are behavioral interventions that help people make better choices, but they risk being paternalistic. For instance, the default option of salad (rather than fries) on a menu can be
seen as a nudge to help people make healthier diet choices. This nudge relies on the findings that people tend to choose whichever option is the default.<sup>1</sup>
