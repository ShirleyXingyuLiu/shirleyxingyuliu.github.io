In the last post, I introduced the concept of self-nudges--an ethical alternative to behavioral nudges. To reap, nudges are behavioral interventions that aim to help people make better choices, but they risk being paternalistic. For instance, the default option of salad (rather than fries) on a menu can be seen as a nudge to help people make healthier diet choices. This nudge relies on the findings that people tend to choose whichever option is the default <sup>1</sup>. While well-intentioned, this nudge paternalistically assumes that everyone wants to prioritize health when they have this meal, which may not be the case. For instance, if Tom wishes to be healthy and resist the temptation of fries, but Sam wishes to indulge whenver he eats out, and they were both influenced by the nudge and ordered fries, only Tom would have benefited from the nudge. It would be better if Tom and Sam can nudge themselves according to their own preferences. For instance, if the restaurant allowed customers to self-nudge and pre-set their own default dishes, then Tom can pre-set salad as his default dish, and Sam can pre-set fries as his.

There are many nudges that aim at facilitating self-control in diet, as well as in other domains <sup>2,3,4</sup>. However, there are very few opportunities for people to self-nudge to facilitate self-control.
