## Framing effect

Read the below two scenarios carefully:

**Scenario 1**

Imagine that you have a friend over for dinner and you are preparing the meal. You know little about food products, but your friend is quite knowlegeable. One of the ingredants you are cooking with is ground beef. You are trying to learn a little about food from your friend and you two begin discussing meat, ground beef in particular. Your friend happens to mention that the ground beef you are using is "85% lean". 

How lean or fatty do you think this ground beef is relative to other ground beef on the market?
