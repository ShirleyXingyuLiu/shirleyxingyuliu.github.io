I am a sixth-year psychology PhD candidate at the UCSD. I am interested in interdisciplinary research on rational decision-making, self-control, conflicting second-order preferences, and causal reasoning. I am passionate about bridging psychological and philosophical research to understand how people make decisions when they are conflicted about what they desire and what they want to desire, how these decisions relate to self-control, and how people causally reason about other people's mental states based on other people's choices. I am looking for a post-doc position for 2026 :)

Ouside of research, I love reading, traveling to new countries, wathicng old movies, and playing music.
