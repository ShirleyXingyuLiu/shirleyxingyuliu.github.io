I am a PhD studnet in Psychology at University of California in San Diego (UCSD). I am experienced and passionate human-subject research, and I specialize in judgement and decision-making. My skills include experimental design, quantitative statistical analysis, interdisciplinary research, and science communication. I am eager to translate my research to real-life questions.
