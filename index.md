<p>
I am a third-year PhD student at the UCSD, studying Experimental Psychology with a specialization in decision making and social cognition. I am passionate about understanding human cognition, and I am experienced in human-subject experimental design, quantitative and qualitative analysis, and interdisciplinary research. I am ready to translate my research to real-life questions.</p>
